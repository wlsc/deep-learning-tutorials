This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications.

* [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) (Coursera)

This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods.
