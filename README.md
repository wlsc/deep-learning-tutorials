## MOOCs

* [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) (Udacity)

Shows how to train and optimize basic neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and long short term memory networks.

* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Coursera)

The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.

* [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations) (Coursera)

In this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.

* [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) (Coursera)

Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc.

* [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) (Coursera)

This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications.

* [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) (Coursera)

This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. 

* [Deep Learning through Transformative Pedagogy](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-through-transformative-uqx-microsoft-education-learnx) (edX)

It explores deep learning by bringing together the most up-to-date research from cognitive psychology, contemporary educational theories, and neuro-scientific perspectives.

## Video lectures

* [Bay Area Deep Learning School. Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyovmAtoUx0) (2016, Stanford)

Must see DL leactures. Speakers: Hugo Larochelle, Andrej Karpathy, Richard Socher, Sherry Moore, Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Andrew Ng.

* [Bay Area Deep Learning School. Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dXiAecyJrY) (2016, Stanford)

Must see DL leactures. Speakers: John Schulman, Pascal Lamblin, Adam Coates, Alex Wiltschko, Quoc Le and Yoshua Bengio.

* [Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu) (2015, Oxford)

By drawing inspiration from neuroscience and statistics, it introduces the basic background on neural networks, back propagation, Boltzmann machines, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. It illustrates how deep learning is impacting our understanding of intelligence and contributing to the practical design of intelligent machines.

* [Deep Learning: Intelligence from Big Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czLI3oLDe8M) (2014, Stanford)

Deep Learning for Big Data.

## Books

* [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) (2009, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman)

Free PDF book. Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction.

## Paper readings
